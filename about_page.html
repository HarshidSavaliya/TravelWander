                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>TravelWander was born as a college project with a vision to revolutionize travel planning in India.
                    What started as an academic endeavor quickly transformed into a passion project for our team of
                    travel enthusiasts.</p>
                <p>We recognized the challenges travelers face when planning their trips - from finding reliable
                    information to booking trustworthy services. TravelWander was created to bridge this gap by offering
                    a comprehensive platform that simplifies travel planning while ensuring authentic experiences.</p>
                <p>Today, we take pride in being a one-stop solution for travelers looking to explore India's rich
                    cultural heritage, breathtaking landscapes, and diverse culinary traditions.</p>
